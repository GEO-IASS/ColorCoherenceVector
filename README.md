ColorCoherenceVector
====================

Color Coherence Vector is a powerful color-based image retrieval.

Here you'll find two files (getCCV,getICCV).

CCV : This is the normal Color Coherence Vector

ICCV : This is an Improved Color Coherence Vector by adding max coherent pixelsâ€™ spatial information without affecting the performance

Parallel implementation based on these papers :

  1) Comparing Images Using Color Coherence Vectors (1996) - http://goo.gl/LkWkbi -
  
  2) An Improved Color Coherence Vector - http://goo.gl/FjXHje -

getCCV and getICCV function take an image and return the Color Coherence Vector that describe this Image. 

You can compare images using this vector.
